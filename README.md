# On-Call Scheduler (OCS)

version indev.1624330708

An app created to make fair scheduling more convenient.

Tauri is used for a lightweight web frontend.

This program is the successor of [Afterhours](https://github.com/trevorkerney/Afterhours), a Python CLI app I designed for the Glasgow Water Company.
